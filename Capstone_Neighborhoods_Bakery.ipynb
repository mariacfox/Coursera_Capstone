    "A new bakery is hoping to open in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area, but the owners aren't sure where to open it. While Cincinnati is a fairly small city, there are distinct neighborhoods with different personalities and characteristics that might influence the success of a small new bakery in town. Additionally, the owners would be competing with several well-known local bakeries that have locations across town, such as Busken Bakery and Servatii.\n",
    "\n",
    "The owners are looking for recommendations for where to locate their bakery. They would like to know **where other successful bakeries are located and the businesses around these successful bakeries** to determine if certain areas or other venues might influence the bakery's success. Based on those characteristics, I will suggest neighborhoods that would be good candidates for opening the new bakery. I will not recommend a neighborhood if there are already two or more successful bakeries in that area. "
